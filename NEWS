Emotion Generic Players 1.9.0

Changes since Emotion Generic Players 1.8.0:
--------------------------------------------

Improvements:

   * Emotion VLC player: debug++
   * Emotion VLC: cleanup: only changed function order in file.
   * Simplify player version dir fallback to match efl 1.9 simplification changes
   * Emotion_generic_players - commented out unused func.
   * Emotion VLC: no more need to send the size twice.

Fixes:

   * Emotion VLC backend: fix pause/stop to work again.
     The EM_CMD_STOP command do not have any parameter so it must be
     handled in the first call of the pipe.
   * Check for libvlc >= 2.0 as a minimum as we use 2.x funcs
   * Emotion VLC: remove quite all the old hacks from loading stage which fixes the problem that
     audio was audible on start
