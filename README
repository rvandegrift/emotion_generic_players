Players for Emotion using "generic" module.

EMOTION GENERIC PLAYERS
=======================

Emotion support multiple modules provided as shared-objects under
${prefix}/lib/emotion/modules, making it extensible. However these
live in the same process as the application, thus problems handling
the media may crash or halt the application. Unfortunately media
handling is very error prone due multiple sources, sinks, decoders et
al, each with their own level of stability.

To solve this emotion ships with a "generic" module that will be a
layer to talk to another process, the "player", using pipes and shared
memory (shm). If this external process dies, the main application
remains working (without any media, of course). Thus it is safer and
have some nice qualities as avoiding bringing in many libraries to
decode media, saving memory in the application process, etc.

A secondary benefit is that the generic player is a separate process
and does not link with the user application code or EFL, avoiding
license conflicts. Many decoding libraries or elements exist in
conflicting licenses with GPL, LGPL or even proprietary code.
